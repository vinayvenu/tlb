#WARNING: THIS HAS BEEN FORKED JUST SO I CAN TRY OUT A FEW THINGS. PLANNING TO THROW IT AWAY ONCE DONE. 
# Rationale:
A typical problem that teams doing CI (continuous integration) try and solve is to get the build time to an acceptable amount so that frequent checkins are possible. However, with a steady increase in the number of tests, the time taken to run these tests on every checkin keeps increasing. Solving this problem in the build is almost always non trivial. This is where parallelizing builds comes handy. Throwing hardware at this problem is one of the potential solutions to get build time under acceptable limits.

**TestLoadBalancer (TLB)** aims at splitting your entire test suite into mutually exclusive units such that each of the unit can be executed in parallel. Assuming that tests are written independent of each other, which is a best practice in writing tests, the tests can be ordered and arranged in anyway and *TLB* leverages this fact in order to split the test suite and reorder the tests.

# Documentation:
Detailed documentation of TLB concepts and configuration options is available in the [TLB wiki](http://wiki.github.com/janmejay/tlb).

# Supported Frameworks:
Currently, *TLB* supports:

  * JUnit using Ant & Buildr
  * [Twistâ„¢](http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/agile-test-automation "ThoughtWorks Studios - Twist") using Ant & Buildr
  * Experimental support for RSpec using Rake. Checkout ["tlb_rb"](http://github.com/janmejay/tlb_rb)

# History:
  *TLB* started in Jan 2010 as an attempt to enhance another similar project called TestLoadBalancer(hosted on code.google.com and github.com). However due to some other issues inheriting the codebase for reuse/enhancement was not possible, besides the direction planned for the new codebase was not aligned with the structure of TestLoadBalancer codebase, so we decided to build *TLB* from scratch. The old TestLoadBalancer originally implemented the idea of load balancing tests based on count, and inspired the creation of *TLB*. The project is not developed or maintained anymore and is not hosted publicly.
